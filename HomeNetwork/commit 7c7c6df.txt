Added user specific page

Added User specific page, directed there via spring security login page.
Utilise the login controller to obtain the username entered into the spring security login form.
This is done using...
Authentication auth = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication(); 
String name = auth.getName();
Also a page redirect has been added for users trying to directly access userprofiles for profiles they do not have access, this includes legitimately logging in as a user then typing in username e.g userpage/dave
Also changed the create userpage to just show either admin or user, prevents -select role-- being chosen.
